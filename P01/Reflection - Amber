This is a quick reflection on what I thought of P01.

Overall the project was alright. I learned about fantasy consoles, which I had no previous knowledge nor experience with.
Some aspects of the project I liked was when me and Justin did the post-it brainstorming on Figma. I also grew to like using Pixel Vision 8 even though I initially bashed it for the text being hard to read.

For the project overall, I think having a clear end goal next time would help. I personally have a hard time getting invested into something if there is no end goal to try to reach. Being able to stop whenever is fine I guess, but it makes the project seem not important? That may just be a personal problem rather than a problem with the project itself.

I appreciate the time Justin is taking to go through these things.
