# P01 Reflection
By Justin Kim

## Summary
P01 is a side-scrolling 2D shooter inspired by retro games such as Galaga. It is a continuation of P00, which was a reference project made with PICO-8 for future studio members. The team switched to Pixel Vision 8 and then to TIC-80 upon finding PV8 was undergoing maintanence during production. Overall a good start with plenty of learning moments.

## The team
The team was comprised of Amber Du and Justin Kim. Justin was the designer, project manager, and resident eccentric while Amber was the developer and a new member of the studio. 

## What we did
Justin and Amber did a brainstorming exercise to ideate new features and additions to make for P01 using Figjam. This was arguably the most fun part of the entire project.

Afterwards we switched to Figma for (digital) paper prototyping, although Justin was unprepared for the session with a concrete plan. Also the fidelity of the graphics were so low and the chosen mechanics were obvious enough that this activity was not required.

Amber was left to implement the new features and changes. Justin was blocked and decided to focus his energies elsewhere.

Throughout the entire project, Justin and Amber met at an approximate cadence of once a week to touch base and keep each other motivated. It's important to note that with the studio at such an early stage, Amber had no expectations and was most likely confused a/o overwhelmed with the project. It would be wise to keep track of what value meetings bring for all involved so that maximum fun occurs for future projects.

We both ended up not being very invested in the project. While it's important to finish games, it's also important to know when to not waste time on finishing them. I believe part of why we gave up was because we didn't have a strong creative direction to guide development with. Luckily this was an off-hand project with a limited scope that we tried, finished, and lost interest in. Future projects should use frameworks such as GDP's design values and the MDA framework to help keep the team focused on their design intentions.

## Reject high-polygon graphics, return to pixel
PICO-8, PV8, and TIC-80 are categorized as "fantasy consoles", or miniature engines designed to emulate the restrictions of older technology and development practices.

Why did we use these tools? Justin made the call because he realized that they were fantastic self-contained environments for rapid prototyping and learning programming. Unfortunately he didn't realize that not everyone wants to code. At the very least, there should be an option for non-coders to better participate and collaborate. 

Thus, Justin has been banished to the dark side of the moon for a time-out. Bad, Justin. Bad.

## Conclusion
Overall Justin was anxious for how this project would have turned out and is glad he and Amber had some fun with it. P01 is not the best project by far but now the studio can look forward to exploring how to apply their learnings from this project and make cooler games.

Justin is grateful towards Amber for going along with his antics. Justin is Member #0 because programmers start with 0. Thus Amber is always #1 to this studio. ðŸ¥‡

As of this article's writing, Justin has been kept in parole inside Grace's basement. Soon he will face the tribunal (Grace's family) for judgement.
