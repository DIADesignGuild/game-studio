# Project Proposal Template

v0.1 - Justin Kim - Nov. 08th, 2021

- Initial proposal.

## Title and premise

Countdown (P00 continuation). A short side-scrolling Galaga-variant with retro graphics for a single player where your broken spaceship escapes waves of enemies before it explodes.
 
## Team and organization

Team: 

- Justin (Project manager & Generalist)
- Aaron (Generalist)

Justin will journal and record his notes, progress, observations, etc. He will also guide Aaron through the game making process.

Aaron will focus on learning and practicing the design process while learning whatever is necessary to make a game.

## Preferred tools

Figma:

- Use a shared file for making paper prototypes.
- Upload file to Github under "P01" folder.

Github: 

- Host game code and documentation. 
- Use game-studio repo in a folder called "P01".

## Prototype goals

Q: 
- How can we better understand the limitations of P00? 
- It's already a playable prototype. 

A: 

- Explore more ideas for refining the core gameplay experience with paper design prototypes in Figma.
- Refine the playable prototype into a core game design prototype in Figma by adding in more mechanics, assets, etc.

## Project timeline and goals

Timeline is subject to change after discussing with Aaron his availability. The proposed timeline is 3 days.

Meetings are flexible and up for discussion. The proposed cadence is:

- 1 meeting for creating the game design document (and any other related materials),
- 1 meeting for brainstorming paper prototypes, and
- 1 meeting for discussing core game prototype.

Milestones:

- Finished paper prototypes (designs).
- Finished core game prototype (design).

P01 reaches completion when a core game design prototype is finalized. P02 with Amber can see her implementing the design while Aaron and Justin focus on playtesting and adjusting mechanics.
