# Website Design
### Code
Make a React app, use this: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
- there should be guides/documentation on what is possible using this
### Server/Host
- need to research into whether I need to buy a domain name and hook it up myself, or if I find some third party thing to host it for me
- do I add database functionality to it? In case people want to save their scores? Should I do IP tracking/cookie stuff to "remember" their session?
- add "account" functionality? LOL might be going too far, but would help in database remembering past scores that were looked up (3/4/2022)
