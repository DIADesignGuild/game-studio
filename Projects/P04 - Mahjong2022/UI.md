# UI Document (not final)

## Information Blurb (How to Use)
I am not sure what this specifically is called, but ideally there is a bubble above the initial screen that tells you how to use the resource. Almost like those "click here to accept that this website is using cookies" thing. This should be skippable/exitable as well.

## Initial Screen (Input Hand)
- keyboard of tiles
- 5 sets of three blank tiles  (with Kan check mark next to each set)
- 1 set of two blank tiles
- 1 blank tile that is outlined in a different color to indicate that this is the winning tile
- **the blank tiles should be double clickable to let them be filled. this is to indicate whether a set/pair is closed or open**
- 'calculate' button somewhere in between the blank tiles and the keyboard

## Secondary Screen (Tally Points)
- maybe have another pop up above the initial screen instead of a separate page
- have a check list of points that add up to the total score
- "Refresh/Redo/Start Over" button that closes out of the pop up and resets the initial screen to be all blank again.
