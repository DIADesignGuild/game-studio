Reference guide for newbies who won but don't know how many points their hand is worth

Need: Convenient way of showing how scores are calculated when playing on an actual table
- Played mahjong with kao (irl) but they didn't know how much points hands were worth but online resources only gave static references that made you calculate manually (tedious)

Agenda
- UI layout for desktop app
  - based off Mahjong Handle
  
Focus on desktop but wants to consider mobile in the future
- Reason: Not familiar with dev for mobile

Not meant for complete newbies, expects users to at least know basic calculations
