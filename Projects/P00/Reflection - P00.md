# Project00 Reflection

- First draft!

## So you want to make a game...

Well that's why you're probably here, reading this. But turn back now if you want a quick-fix secret on how to easily make games without the hard work. (I'm kidding. Please come back. Stop running-) 

Unfortunately I'm the one who's going to break the bad news. Games are hard things to make. Their conceptualization, production, testing, marketing, and all the "-ing"'s involved require patience, a positive mindset, and a deference towards the greater good of the game.

These bright and flashy things already demand so much of you. To embark on this endeavor alone is just adding to the stress. 

## Can working in teams make game creation easier?

But what if I told you working with others holds the key to less angushing stress and more fun stress?

## The dilemma of flying solo

Here's a story you may have heard of. One day a young lad wanted to make a game. He started his journey by getting all his tools, assets, and ideas into one neat little row. But soon he realized that getting stuck with no one to bounce ideas off of made him lonely and less motivated to finish the game.

This was the story of the very first game I ever made as a teen. And as history does, it repeated itself when I relived this story making Project00 on my own.

Why did I work alone on a game again if I already learned my lesson? Well working by oneself isn't inherently a negative thing. Sometimes you don't have like-minded folks around you at the moment or want to work on a very personal game. In this case I wanted to prove that, as the guy who established the DIA Game Studio, I not only knew how to make games but knew how to guide others in making them.

Project00 was interesting for me. Up to now I had only learned Lua for PICO-8 development by following tutorials. It was a tad frightening for me to take a step on my own. In the end I realized it wasn't nearly so bad an experience. However it could have been better.

## Another story

I'll share one more story from my life. In college I had this amazing friend who was also into creative writing. One night during finals week we camped at the library. While our brains intended to study, of course our hearts diverted us to making little scenarios and exaggerations about the people in our lives. I still remember that night to this day because together we made some of our best stories ever.

I think that night is so memorable to me because I realized how fun it was to collaborate with someone else.

## Birds of a feather

If I had to take away one lesson from working on Project00, it's that having someone else to discuss ideas, challenge assumptions, and maintain encouraging energy with would have increased my enjoyment of the process by tenfold.

One of my core motivations for making this studio is to have fun making games with others. I want a space for creative individuals to come together and not only make great things, but make great moments in the process. That's why I'm advocating hard for working together instead of apart. By synergizing as a team everyone involved gets to have fun making fun, which is how it should be. Struggling to be creative makes no sense to me. After all we're interested in game making *because we have fun playing them*!

## Where do we go from here?

These are early times at DIA Game Studio. I've only recently kickstarted this shindig and the only finished project at the time of writing this reflection is P00. However I'd like to share some of my plans for the future of the studio.

First and foremost, I'm getting the band together. I've picked some apprentices who I believe fit the bill for the type of people this space is meant for. And I'm going to get them acclimated to the game making process.

Second, once a core team is in place we'll move towards having each of them manage their own projects. Hopefully we'll have enough new additions to the studio to give everyone a little crew to travel the game making stars with.

Third, eventually we'll refine our craft. I'm talking about really practicing the game making process diligently and crafting quality experiences that players love.

All of this, of course, is under the assumption that we're all enjoying ourselves. The main goal is to progress while motivating ourselves by having fun together. So let's get out there and make some games!
