# Project0X Proposal

v0.1 - Justin Kim - Nov. 08th, 2021

- Initial proposal.

## Title and premise

Candyvania. 2D traditional Castlevania-style platformer where one player fights five 1 min. waves of candy demons inside a giant liqorice stick to save the world from the sweets of the night.
 
## Team and organization

Team: 

- Justin (Project manager & Generalist)
- Aaron (Generalist)

Justin will journal and record his notes, progress, observations, etc. He will also guide Aaron through the game making process.

Aaron will focus on learning and practicing the design process while learning whatever is necessary to make a game.

## Preferred tools

Figma:

- Use a shared file for making paper prototypes.
- Upload file to Github under "P0X" folder.

Fantasy console: 

- [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Costs $15 and has the best support and community. Lots of resources for learning. Justin already knows PICO-8.
- [Pixel Vision 8](https://pixelvision8.itch.io/pv8). Open-source with more features. Lets you create games in both Lua and C#. More flexible than PICO-8 but loses the benefits of forced constraints. Justin needs to learn this one too.

Final decision: Tell Aaron about the differences and ask for his thoughts. Justin already has and prefers PICO-8, but believes it's not fair to ask Aaron to spend money.

Github: 

- Host game code and documentation. 
- Use game-studio repo in a folder called "P0X".

## Prototype goals

Q: 

- How might we explore this concept and understand what its requirements are?
- How might we better understand the play experience of this game pertaining to what players can do in it?

A: 

- Create paper design prototypes in Figma to explore different mechanics.
- Create a playable prototype in a fantasy console to focus on in-game actions/verbs.

## Project timeline and goals

Timeline is subject to change after discussing with Aaron his availability. The proposed timeline is 5 days.

Meetings are flexible and up for discussion. The proposed cadence is:

- 1 meeting to discuss general logistics,
- 1 meeting for creating the game design document (and any other related materials),
- 1 meeting for brainstorming paper prototypes, 
- 1 meeting for discussing the playable prototype, and 
- 1 meeting for implementing the playable prototype.

Milestones:

- Finished paper prototypes (designs).
- Finished playable game prototype.

P0X reaches completion when a playable prototype is finalized. P0X can continue to be refined in a future project.
