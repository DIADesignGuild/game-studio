- This one from that SAI writing event where each person started off writing a couple of words on a Google spreadsheet and then everyone shifted over to the next page to add more words by building off the previous person's words. There's a timer and theme to help keep things moving.
  - Maybe thinking of a theme/setting beforehand for the spread?

[How to Calculate Your Tarot Birth Card, Plus Short Birth Card Meanings: Infographic](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/learn-tarot-with-labyrinthos-academy/how-to-calculate-your-tarot-birth-card-plus-short-birth-card-meanings-infographic)
- Birth cards are kind of like the zodiac
- Breakdown birthdate into 2 digit blocks for month, day, and year
  - MM + DD + YY + YY
- If sum is a 2 digit number, add digits together for 1st birth card. Then divide into 2 digits again for 2nd birth card if you get a single digit; otherwise reduce to 1 digit.
  - Ex: 11 + 22 + 20 + 00 = 53
    - 5 + 3 = 8: Strength, 1st card
    - 8 = 1 + 7 = 17: The Star, 2nd card
  - Ex: 07 + 30 + 19 + 26 = 82
    - 8 + 2 = 10: The Wheel of Fortune, 1st card
    - 1 + 0 = 1: The Magician, 2nd card
- If sum is 3 digit number, add first 2 digits with 3rd digit as a separate # for 1st birth card. Then add digits to find 2nd card or reduce to 1 digit.
  - 01 + 13 + 19 + 97 = 130
  - 13 + 0 = 13, Death, 1st card
  - 1 + 3 = 4, The Emperor, 2nd card
- Exception: When sum = 19, there's 3 birth cards.
  - Reason: Not very clear why you'd get 3 birth cards if your sum is 19.
- Combos (the querent's life journey)
  - 21 > 3: The World, Empress
    - Path of self-actualization guided by love.
  - 20 > 2: Judgement, High Priestess

[The Tarot and the Tree of Life Correspondences](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/learn-tarot-with-labyrinthos-academy/the-tarot-and-the-tree-of-life-correspondences)
- 22 Major arcana cards: 22 letters of Hebrew alphabet
- 4 suits: Tetragrammaton (God's 4 letter name)
- Tree of Life = diagram describing universal laws of reality
  - Downwards = human body, unconscious
  - Upwards = Divine source of soul, higher self
  - 10 nodes (sephirah; minor arcana), 22 connective paths (major arcana)
  - Each connective path is a lesson necessary to learn to move to next node. Collectively called the Path of the Serpent; represents journey to divine and to spiritual healing.
    - But they don't talk about what the lessons are?
    - I assume the lessons are related to each Major arcanum card's symbolic meaning.
    - Yeah the symbolic meanings don't line up either.
  - Each major arcana correlates with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which has its own semantic and symbolic meanings
    - Ex: The Fool corresponds to the letter Aleph, which semantically means Ox and symbolically means primal energy.
    - There's a whole table.
    - Ngl I have no clue how the Tarot cards relate to their supposed corresponding letters.
  - The Minor arcana suites each correspond to an element, letter, and world
    - Wands : Fire : Yod (Closed hand) : Atziluth (the world of Emanation; Divine; Faculty of intuition)
    - Cups : Water : He (window) : Beri'ah (world of creation; spirit; faculty of feeling)
    - Swords : Air : Vau (Hook, nail) : Yetzirah (world of formation, psyche, faculty of thinking)
    - Pentacles : Earth : He : Assiah (world of manifestation, body, faculty of sensation)
    - This is where the minor arcana suite "associations" come from
    - In the Kabbalah, there's 4 worlds, each of which correspond with a letter in the Tetragrammaton (Yod, He, Vau/waw, He)
      - They're all connected to make a ladder connecting the material and divine worlds; referred to as Jacob's Ladder, a stairway to heaven that Jacob dreamed about in the Bible.
      - Material world > formation world > Creation world > Emanation world (the source, the root)
      - Each world/suite is made of 10 nodes/cards (not counting court cards) that interlock with each other. Starts w/ 10 at the bottom, goes up to Ace at the top.
  - Each node is a diff aspect of God/Self/Pysche
    - Individually called a sephirah, collectively called a sephiroth
    - Top (the Ace) is closest to God/Self/Psyche, and as you go down closer you get to manifestation/material world. 
    - Ace of Wands is closest to Divine. 10 of Pentacles is closest to material world.
    - Ace/1 - Kether/Crown
      - Closest to god, unity, eternal source, pureness, potential
    - 2 - Chokmah/Wisdom
      - divine masculine, expression of full power of suit(?), insight
    - 3 - Binah/Understanding
      - divine feminine, harmony, contemplation
    - 4 - Chesed/Mercy
      - stability, discipline, structure, form
    - 5 - Geburah/Severity
      - destruction, motion, change, upheaval, chaos
    - 6 - Tiphareth/Beauty  
      - consciousness, balance, integration, connecting divine and physical
    - 7 - Netzach/Victory
      - strength, determination, concentration
    - 8 - Hod/Splendor
      - communication, expression of energy, reasoning, action, movement
    - 9 - Yesod/Foundation
      - refinement, reflection, imagination
      - To move to 8/Splendor, one must learn 
    - 10 - Malkuth/Kingdom
      - physical world, energies manifest, tangible form of all emanations
  - Nodes 2+3, 4+5, 7+8, are all counterparts/related in someway.
- Apparently the court cards are related to astrology

[Kishotenketsu](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kishotenketsu)
- "While often touted as a story format "without conflict", it is more accurate to say that kishotenketsu doesn't have a driving conflict — that is, a confrontation that the entire story revolves around. The third act twist is the centerpoint of the story, but while it may introduce a conflict, **characters don't actually have to engage with it (on-screen) in order for the story to conclude.** The twist is more often a Non Sequitur, e.g. **a sudden Perspective Flip that recontextualizes the story without changing its overall direction**, than an outright Plot Twist."
- "This allows him to introduce a new mechanic in a safe environment (ki), raise the stakes for the player (sho), put an unexpected complication on it (ten), and finally bring all previous ideas together for the home run to the finish pole (ketsu)."

[THE SKELETAL STRUCTURE OF JAPANESE HORROR FICTION](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/japanese-horror-structure/)/Can Story Grammar Speak Japanese?
- It's about who desires and who doesn't. The classical protagonist lacks desire. The classical antagonist engages in goal-seeking behavior that ends with his downfall. 
- Japanese stories can end with plot events or emphasis on the story's ideas or virtues. 
  - The former results in stories that "make sense". Things end somehow. The Western equivalent would attempt to resolve any unanswered dramatic questions based on plot events in its resolution.
  - The latter results in stories that "don't make sense", such as the ending of Urashima Taro, The Sopranos, or an Aesopian fable that ends with a focus on a moral lesson.
- If you notice a lot of J-Horror stories, they tend to involve protagonists such as regular students who don't do anything to kickstart the plot events. If anything, the plot events happen to them via actions that force them to react. 
- Japanese tales tend to involve a "simple reaction" and "action" structure w/o a goal for the protagonist, and a "complex reaction" and "goal-path" structure with a goal for the antagonist.
- Western stories tend to be about solving a problem/conflict, Japanese stories tend to be about discovering and understanding the truth of the matter at hand.
  - J-Horror stories tend to be about discovering the horrific severity of the situation.
  - Japanese stories tend to introduce a perspective in the Setup, elaborates on this perspective in the Development, introduces another perspective in the Twist that recontextualizes the first perspective, and reconciles the 2nd perspective with the 1st (aka explains wtf the 2nd perspective means/how it's connected to the 1st).
    - It's like an unfolding structure. You unfold a paper once to the left in Setup and then unfold it to the left once again in Development. Then you unfold it to the right once in Twist and again in that direction in Reconciliation to see the entire paper.
    - KTSK is like unfolding a folded piece of paper to see what it looks like completely unfolded. 
- Western storytelling usually has a change in the status-quo. Japanese storytelling usually doesn't change the status quo. The Twist doesn't change anything, rather it offers a new perspective on the status quo.
