4.  Set the timer and write 1 line of words, up to 12 words per line, for each card within 12 minutes.
    1.  Use the theme from the table.
    2.  Each card's keyword must be incorporated into its line at least once.
5.  If you write within the time and word limits, use the theme, and include all keywords then you've succeeded.
    1.  If not, restart the timer, keep any complete lines, and discard any unfinished lines.
    2.  Lower the word limit by 2 words and begin writing again. Feel free to change previous lines.
    3.  If the word limit goes below 0, delete your story and start over from scratch.
    4.  Once you succeed, restore the word limit to its default value.
6.  If you've succeeded and want to write a sequel story, draw new cards for the Development, Twist, and Conclusion to make a new spread but use your previous Conclusion card as the new Setup card.
