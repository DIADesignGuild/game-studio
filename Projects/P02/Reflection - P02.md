# P02 Reflection

## Tl;dr-
- I made a writing game using Tarot cards
- A lack of a deadline meant I spent too much time
- At least now I know I want to make digital games rather than board games
- gimme yer dopahmeens

## Overview
P02 is an educational and story-writing game using Tarot cards.

So basically you use the Kishotenketsu structure to write a story but for each "part" (Setup, Development, Twist, Reconciliation) you use the meaning of a Tarot card you draw to write the story at this point. There's also additional cards for Setting and Character.

## Weird games
This game came out of an idea: what if you could learn about Tarot cards _and_ Kishotenketsu at the same time? It was a fun little experiment to see what this might look like.

Unfortunately, as most experiments go, I wasn't sure about the outcome. How could I? This isn't exactly a genre nor is there much like this I can find out there.

I'm very fond of weird games like this. Funny little experiments that try out new things. Sometimes they're fun, sometimes they're disappointing. But the spirit of making is there.

## The Tarot
I joined a Tarot group awhile back and wanted to make a game we could all play. There were a lot of beginners in the group, so I aimed to make a game that would cater to them. I believe the most common method for learning the Tarot is to create keywords for each card and remember them during readings. This ended up becoming a mechanic in the game but I wanted to do something more. Readings are fun but I usually did them with others. Using cards to write stories became a substitute for a lack of social interaction in the method.

## Kishotenketsu
Once the guy who directed Super Mario Land 3D mentioned this, everyone under the sun rushed to learn this trendy new narrative structure. Aside from the disturbing fact that there were more whites talking about this than Asians, I decided to use this structure in the game to help those whose heritages are Sino-influenced have fun with making tales that reflect a side of them that hasn't had the chance to thrive (at least for me). 

## Making this thing
If there was something I should have changed, it was to create a hard-set deadline. I spent way too many nights struggling with this. I feel a lot of that redundancy ended up burning me out. However it's not so simple as to just say "I'll end here". How do you end something that doesn't _need_ to end?

In terms of passion projects and hard deadlines, I really appreciate game jams. They force us to finish and be creative in the process. But the schedule of a dedicated jam timeline isn't so easy to incorporate into your everyday life. Things happen. You end up with a mountain of emails to respond to, designs and documents need your attention, and god knows what else. And this isn't accounting for the unique challenges of working from home. When boundaries are blurred, how can you tell where you are?

Also this stopped becoming fun to do at some point. For me, it didn't feel _tangible_. I didn't feel like I was in the kind of magic circle I wanted this game to create. The most enjoyable part of the process was definitely creating characters and scenarios for framing this game. Creating this _world_ was most satisfying for me. Maybe I'm too much of a writer to focus strictly on game design, haha.

## Excitement/Stimulation
P02's process, thankfully, helped me realize something important: I want to focus on digital experiences. Physical games are fun, however they can quickly get lonely. Also factoring in my need for stimulation, digital experiences more easily capture the kinds of stimulating experinces _I_ need to enjoy myself. 

Neurodiversity is something I've been coming to terms with while making this. And one thing I learned recently is that some ND minds may need a lot of stimuli to really function properly. For the longest time I thought I had to force myself to like the things I took an interest in. "I need to be more excited", I'd think to myself as I slogged at creating a tilemap in RPG Maker after graduating highschool. "I need to keep doing this until I like it", I thought as I racked my brain for designing more features while making P02. I only realize now, after going through the gauntlet again, that perhaps I don't need to "fit" myself into game making. Rather, I should "fit" game making to me by incorporating things that make me pleased. My list so far includes:
- Music
- Story
- "Doing" (interactivity, essentially; basically I want to do something with my fingers aside from transcripting my thoughts. I want my imagination to _become_ something real.)
- Cool visuals (for most humans, we use our eyes the most)
- I'll end up thinking of more

But this is a lot of things. How do I manage all of this? Collaboration is one way, but committment is a difficult obstacle. But at least for now, I know for certain that I want to work with digital objects. Perhaps I need to allocate space in my game making process for things that I _want_ to do, such as making visual assets and writing. I could always just find pre-made music to stick in, anyway. 

Which leads me back to stimulation. I thought all this time that "Excitement" was something I was bound to feel at some point. But really, I need to make that excitement happen by stimulating myself. Can't expect the Algorithmâ„¢ to do all the work. **CLICKS MOUSE**

## Showing the group
Overall, there were some people interested but I'm not sure if anyone actually played. No one said anything, and I'm pretty tired of working on this, so I'll just file this away in the GStudio archives until it's time to pick it up again.
