# Mahjong Resource Design Document

This project will be a web-based application where someone can calculate how many points their winning hand is worth. It will calculate points for Taiwanese-style Mahjong. (potentially extending to other styles of Mahjong, depends how far I get with this)


## Proposed Mechanics
- initial screen with empty slots and tiles to choose from
- clickable/draggable tiles to designated empty slots
- 'Submit' button
- secondary screen to show calculated score along with which tiles gave them those points
- 'Refresh'/'Redo' button to return to first screen

## What will need to be decided
- how to host the website (buy own domain/server?)
- what language to use to code this thing
- algorithm
- UI/UX
- should it be mobile compatible?

Things can be added/modified as needed. Just laying out the basic ideas out for now. (2/3/2022)
