- Problem: I made the floor tiles and successfully pasted them onto my Tilemap. But when I made a plant into a 1x2 tile, the bottom would appear on top of the floor just fine but the top would erase the floor tile and the background would be the transparency. 
  - Process: I tried adjusting all the settings like the occlusion, offsets, modulate, etc. But nothing gave me feedback towards understanding how I can make the plant appear like it's on top of the floor.
  - Twist: I looked for help online and someone mentioned having more than 1 tilemap.
  - Solution: The key lay in the z-indexes and multiple tilemaps. I realized that a better strategy than forcing all tiles to work on 1 tilemap was to keep my original tilemap for the ground tiles and then make _another_ tilemap for the objects. Then I gave the objects tilemap a z-index of 1 while the floor tilemap received a z-index of 0. This way the objects tilemap's contents appear on top of the floor tilemap's contents. But another key was to set the object tilemap's tiles' z-indexes to 1 as well. ~~From the looks of things, it seems that the z-index property reaches across layers.~~
    - **Each layer of tiles should be on separate tilemaps and z-indexes. Each tilemap layer and its objects should share the same z-index.**
