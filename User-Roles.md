    - How long of a game are you making?
    - What is the goal a designer wants to achieve from the game?
        - Which tool would do that?
2. Would the designer need some kind of technical knowledge (like coding)?
    - How detailed would the baseline knowledge need to be?
    - Does the technical onboarding affect the overall onboarding process?
3. What kind of existing ideas/artifacts/prototypes exist already when the apprentice joins the game studio?
4. How much game design mechanics and particular concepts will the apprentices be learning through their projects?
