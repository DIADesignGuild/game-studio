# DIA Design Guild's Game Studio

## 👋 What is the DIA Game Studio?

The Game Studio is a place for DIA members to learn game making and produce game-related deliverables.

This repo is used to host studio documentation, game projects, and any other resources we intend to share amongst ourselves.

The Game Studio Proposal outlines general logistics all members should acquaint themselves with.

Each project has its own folder/directory to host materials. Everything is public to easily share our final deliverables and showcase studio growth to others.
