v0.1 - Justin Kim - Oct. 19th, 2021

- Makeshift version to get the ball rolling. 

## Title and premise

What can we call your game? A temporary name is fine.

Like a movie with a good concept, you can describe a game in one sentence, or a log line.

- Is the game long? Will it take me a couple of seconds? Minutes? Hours?
- Does this game fit into a genre? Is it experimental? What other games are like this (or aren't)?
- What's the hook? What sort of irony attracts the player's attention?
- What's the experience, the meat of the game? What does this game's scenario have to offer?
- Who are the intended players? Can they expect big-budget production or humble efforts?
- What's the cool title? This comes first, but sometimes you only get it at the end.
 
## Team and organization

- Who's doing what?
- How does everyone collaborate with each other?

## Preferred tools

- What are you using to build the prototype?

## Prototype goals

- What is the hypothesis? What questions about the game do we need answered?
- What kind of prototype will be made? Art and sound? Playable? Physical?

## Project timeline and goals

- What's the meeting cadence?
- What are the important milestones?
- How do we know this project is finished?
