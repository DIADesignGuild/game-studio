- Basic template to get the ball rolling.
- Questions are meant to encourage brainstorming and ideation.

## Working title

What's your game called?

## Gameplay description

How would you describe your game? Think of it as a summary of the game's overall design. It should be understandable by someone who's never played this game before. 

## Goal(s)

What goals are players trying to achieve in your game? What's the end result?

## 6 Basic elements

The "atoms" of the game, they're important elements that gives it a more concrete form.

### Players

- How many players are there?
- Who plays this game?
- Is anyone else watching?

### Goals

- When does the player stop?

### Actions

- What can the player do to accomplish their goals?

### Objects

- What does the player interact with?

### Playspace

- Where is the player?

### Rules

- What can the player do/not do?

## Design values

What does your game's design prioritize? You should always refer back to these while fleshing out the game.

### Experience

What can the player do? What do players *experience* when they play your game? Ex: Mario lets players experience what it's like to be a jumping plumber who rescues a princess. 

### Theme

What's the game about? What ideas, concepts, or arguments is your game communicating to the players?

### Point of view

During gameplay, what do players see, hear, and/or feel? Ex: When playing Mario, what view of the game world do players see? Answer: They see a sideview of the levels Mario jumps through. This can also include POV's such as cultural undersatnding, presentation of information, etc.

### Challenge

What stops the player from achieving their goals without any effort? Are there any constraints that add a dimension of fun?

### Decision-making

How are decisions made by players? Do they have to use muscle memory or apply a set of basic principles to a series of new situations?

### Skill, strategy, chance, and uncertainty

In what way do these factors impact gameplay? The game experience? How are they all balanced with each other and other elements?

### Context

Who are the players? Where do they play this game? When will they play the game? What platform will this game be on? 

Ex: Handheld games such as the ones on the Gameboy line had a feature for saving at any point in the game because the Gameboy platform, a handheld console, was meant to be taken on the go and both played and shutdown anywhere, anytime. Target players probably included people who commuted via trains and had a variety of stops depending on the time of day. 

### Emotions

What do players feel when playing the game? Fear? Sadness? An irresistable urge to eat gummy bears?

## Interface and controls

Insert wireframes here -->

Wireframes depicting game screen, information layout and representation, player interaction, etc.

## Game flow

Flow chart showing intended use case(s) along with wireframes.

## Level design

Each level should be explained by a brief overall summary and annotated map or other way to visualize and point out specific details in it.

## Art direction

The "look, feel, and sound" of the game. Essentially a series of deliverables showing the game's aesthetics.

Example deliverables include:
- Moodboard with annotated photo and sound references
- Concept art
- Sample audio

## Technical overview

If the game requires a lot of technical know-how, this is where we give the run-down. While more of an implementation deliverable, the technical overview's still good for giving the development team a sense of how this game will be built (in code, etc).
