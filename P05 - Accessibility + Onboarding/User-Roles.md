### Questions to figure out in the onboarding process

1. Look at the tools, see what kind of games they make
    - How long of a game are you making?
    - What is the goal a designer wants to achieve from the game?
        - Which tool would do that?
        - [Tool list](https://github.com/DIADesignGuild/game-studio/blob/User-Roles-Justin/Resources/Game%20Making%20Tools.md).
            - We recommend Twine, Bitsy, or GB Studio.
        - [Example games list](https://github.com/DIADesignGuild/game-studio/blob/main/Resources/Example-Games.md).
            - Focused on Twine, Bitsy, and GB Studio games.
2. Would the designer need some kind of technical knowledge (like coding)?
    - How detailed would the baseline knowledge need to be?
    - Does the technical onboarding affect the overall onboarding process?
3. What kind of existing ideas/artifacts/prototypes exist already when the apprentice joins the game studio?
4. How much game design mechanics and particular concepts will the apprentices be learning through their projects?
5. See [Project Proposal Template](https://github.com/DIADesignGuild/game-studio/blob/User-Roles-Justin/Project%20Proposal%20-%20Template.md) for more project-related questions.
