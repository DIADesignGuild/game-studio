# P02 Tests
5 play tests should do the trick *smth smth Jakob Nielsen*

## Test 1

### Cards
Setting: Knight of Cups (R)
Character: 8 of Pentacles
Setup: X of Cups
Development: 3 of Hearts (R)
Twist: 9 of Wands
Conclusion: Ace of Swords (R)

### Values
Sum = 43
Mystic Number = 21
Theme = Epic

### Limits
Time limit: 10min
Line-word limit: 25 words/line

### Story
- A war has been ravaging Ultaria for years, resulting in a stalemate.
- Marcus is a humble merchant who works quietly in his shop.
- Marcus's shop is prosperous and he has an opportunity to expand his business from the little town of Halisburg to the entire kingdom. 
- Marcus's heart wavers. Is he truly doing what's right by helping further violence against innocents? He enlists three spies to dismantle both sides.
- Marcus succeeds too well. His spy network does their job but they give him up upon interrogation and he loses his business.
- Thanks to Marcus's efforts the war ends in a peace treaty. However he is jaded by his experiences and leaves Ultaria in self-exile.

### Notes
- 10min felt like just enough time to write and reconsider points in a story without taking too long. 
  - Maybe lessen by a min or 2?
  - Gave room for margin of error. Ex: I thought the Character card was first and when I realized I made that mistake, I had enough time to go back and change it.
- 25 words/line is too lenient. Perhaps reducing to 13 words/line will make things more fun.
- It got the job done. But is it fun?


## Test 2

### Cards
Setting: 9 of Pentacles (R)
Character: 6 of Wands
Setup: 20 - Judgement (R)
Development: 9 of Swords
Twist: Queen of Wands
Conclusion: Ace of Cups (R)

### Values
Sum = 58
Mystic Number = 14
Theme = Crime

### Limits
Time limit: 9min
Line-word limit: 13 words/line

### Story
- A prominent hotel tycoon's death leaves her wealth to those in her will.
- Jewelcia's an amateur sleuth who solved a successful case involving a stolen emerald.
- The tofty granddaughter, invites Jewelcia to the reading in case of an incident.  
- Jewelcia finds the lawyer murdered before he could read the will.
- Despite the heirs' belief the tycoon did dirty business, she's completely clean.
- The jealous heirs all collaborated to kill the tycoon. 

### Notes
- Just made it in time with a 9min time limit.
  - Let's see how 8 minutes fares.
- 13 words was just about right for being forced to write quickly while still having the story make sense.
- While it's annoying to count words individually, skill arises in gaining an intuition for appx how many words a line is as the player keeps playing.
- Listened to Abb on this one (Lay all your love on me original + disconet remix, SOS)
- I definitely want to play again. Yesterday's lacked challenge and thus urgency. With these new constraints I feel energized and wanting more.
- Having the theme be chosen after drawing helps upend any preconceptions of stories the players form in their heads as they draw the cards.


## Test 3

### Cards
Setting: 6 of Pentacles (R)
Character: Ace of Swords
Setup: Queen of Cups (R)
Development: 8 of Wands (R)

- During the race new death traps kill most drivers.
- Lancer saves Lianna from dying by sharing their health money.
- Lancer wins and retires. Liana visits them and their family.

### Notes
- 8min gave more urgency than 9min and left me with 2-3 min to spare.
  - A little awkward bc there's too much time to just wait and not much time to really refine.
  - Should lower to 6 min (1 min per card)
- Need to definitely get rid of the alternative themes.
- Having an even line-word limit was
