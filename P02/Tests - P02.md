# P02 v0.2 Tests
5 play tests should do the trick *smth smth Jakob Nielsen*


## Test 1

### Cards
Setting: Knight of Cups (R)
Character: 8 of Pentacles
Setup: X of Cups
Development: 3 of Hearts (R)
Twist: 9 of Wands
Conclusion: Ace of Swords (R)

### Values
Sum = 43
Mystic Number = 21
Theme = Epic

### Limits
Time limit: 10min
Line-word limit: 25 words/line

### Story
- A war has been ravaging Ultaria for years, resulting in a stalemate.
- Marcus is a humble merchant who works quietly in his shop.
- Marcus's shop is prosperous and he has an opportunity to expand his business from the little town of Halisburg to the entire kingdom. 
- Marcus's heart wavers. Is he truly doing what's right by helping further violence against innocents? He enlists three spies to dismantle both sides.
- Marcus succeeds too well. His spy network does their job but they give him up upon interrogation and he loses his business.
- Thanks to Marcus's efforts the war ends in a peace treaty. However he is jaded by his experiences and leaves Ultaria in self-exile.

### Notes
- 10min felt like just enough time to write and reconsider points in a story without taking too long. 
  - Maybe lessen by a min or 2?
  - Gave room for margin of error. Ex: I thought the Character card was first and when I realized I made that mistake, I had enough time to go back and change it.
- 25 words/line is too lenient. Perhaps reducing to 13 words/line will make things more fun.
- It got the job done. But is it fun?


## Test 2

### Cards
Setting: 9 of Pentacles (R)
Character: 6 of Wands
Setup: 20 - Judgement (R)
Development: 9 of Swords
Twist: Queen of Wands
Conclusion: Ace of Cups (R)

### Values
Sum = 58
Mystic Number = 14
Theme = Crime

### Limits
Time limit: 9min
Line-word limit: 13 words/line

### Story
- A prominent hotel tycoon's death leaves her wealth to those in her will.
- Jewelcia's an amateur sleuth who solved a successful case involving a stolen emerald.
- The tofty granddaughter, invites Jewelcia to the reading in case of an incident.  
- Jewelcia finds the lawyer murdered before he could read the will.
- Despite the heirs' belief the tycoon did dirty business, she's completely clean.
- The jealous heirs all collaborated to kill the tycoon. 

### Notes
- Just made it in time with a 9min time limit.
  - Let's see how 8 minutes fares.
- 13 words was just about right for being forced to write quickly while still having the story make sense.
- While it's annoying to count words individually, skill arises in gaining an intuition for appx how many words a line is as the player keeps playing.
- Listened to Abb on this one (Lay all your love on me original + disconet remix, SOS)
- I definitely want to play again. Yesterday's lacked challenge and thus urgency. With these new constraints I feel energized and wanting more.
- Having the theme be chosen after drawing helps upend any preconceptions of stories the players form in their heads as they draw the cards.


## Test 3

### Cards
Setting: 6 of Pentacles (R)
Character: Ace of Swords
Setup: Queen of Cups (R)
Development: 8 of Wands (R)

- Lancer wins and retires. Liana visits them and their family.

### Notes
- 8min gave more urgency than 9min and left me with 2-3 min to spare.
  - A little awkward bc there's too much time to just wait and not much time to really refine.
  - Should lower to 6 min (1 min per card)
- Need to definitely get rid of the alternative themes.
- Having an even line-word limit was

### Notes
- Had to move the Twist-reverse rule towards the top to avoid conflict with list rule.
- Need to add a time limit to making list.
  - 6 min?
- Should specify that the list should be a separate document to stash keywords.
  - Google Sheets?
- What do I do about repeating Mystic Questions?
  - Make it so that only the dominant element's question is asked.
  - 1 question for all acts
- Mystic Combo: Specify that only one of them has to be reversed to count as a Y
  - Just remove the Combos?
  - Not related to tarot or KSTK
- Does this really help people read spreads, tho?
  - Spreads aren't always intimately interconnected (see: the lyrics spread using The Motel's song in SASS server)
  - [ASSUMPTION] Assuming players understand the KSTK explanation, they'll naturally see if the story they write "makes sense", i.e. they're following the KSTK structure.
- Do these questions make sense?
  - Change to answer for each act card
- Is this too many rules/mechanics?
  - Do I just need to increase the time limit to give them breathing room?
    - Increase time limit to 12 min.
    - Increase word limit to 12 words.
- **Make sequel story for Test 2**
- 8 words/line might be too little.
  - Should raise it.
  - Raise it to 12.
- Add rule for loss where you can change any lines if you need to.
  - This story didn't make sense with how I wrote it.
- Clarify rules for failure; what else involves failing?
  - Ex: Not including keywords?
  - What do I do if I realize I didn't include a keyword? Does it count as a failure?

## Test 2

### Cards
Setting: 2 of Pentacles (R) - Unbalanced
Character: 4 of Wands (R) - Instability
Setup: King of Wands (R) - Vicious
Development: Knight of Swords - Calculating
Twist: 13 - Death (R) - Stagnation
Reconciliation: Knight of Wands (R) - Arrogant

### Values
Sum: 57
Mystic Number: 13
Theme: Supernatural

### Question
Wands: What are your character's gut feelings?

### Limits
Time limit: 12 minutes
Word limit: 12 words/line

### Story
- The world is unbalanced. 
- Brianne's marriage faces instability. 
- Brianne wants to scream at husband; he announces divorce at her shop.
- Her life unravels thanks to her husband's calculating lawyer and mistress.
- Shop faces stagnation thanks to the divorce until Brianne finds a recording.
- Husband's arrogance led to video of him clearly cheating. He's ruined.

### Notes
- What do I do if there's no element with the most cards?
- Can I have multiple sentences in one line?
  - Accounted for by "1 line of words"
- Forgot to incorporate question while writing.
  - Maybe have another round of writing to incorporate it?
  - Instead have card's line focus on its element's question?
  - Yeah, forcing 1 question for all act cards doesn't feel like it works. This reflects a Western approach. Each Act card's quesiton should be individualized for its element.
    - Ex: If you get a Wand card, you ask a Wand question. Etc.
    - Maybe this can apply for all cards, not just Acts...
      - For now, just Act cards
- Considering I forgot to incorporate questions, 12 min. might actually be too short.


## Test 3

Development: 16 - The Tower (R) - Construction

- A community suffers from grief after a tragic plane accident.
- The lone survivor withdrew from the world to sit in contemplation.

- He gains hope by procrastinating on opening it, reconstructing his life.
- The letter opens itself by accident and he discovers his mother died.
- He goes on a reckless drive, crashes into a river, and dies.

### Notes
- **What if we have players answer questions right after making keywords?**
  - If this doesn't work, I think I should take out the Mystic Questions
  - Do these questions even make sense? It's hard to retroactively apply them.
  - What about repeats? Will they just be unecessar?
  - If we do this without even writing, how will the ?'s even inform the story?
    - Frame the rule as discovering the character's emotional journey.
- Do I need to use the exact keyword? Or can I use a different form of it?
  - Ex: tense
  - Made it so that players can incorporate keyword as they see fit.
- I forgot to use the questions again while writing. Had to look at them again afterwards.
  - Maybe the questions are the issue.
    - Should test this for v0.4, if they end up in v0.3

#### Just take out Mystic questions
