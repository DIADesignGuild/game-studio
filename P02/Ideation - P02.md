# Project02 Ideation

## Agenda

### Ideation

- Share [FigJam file](https://www.figma.com/file/aBs8LAz2j8Jr4bAB3aXHt4/P02_Ideating?node-id=0%3A1)
- Context: P00 lets you move up and down on the screen to avoid incoming meteors. Each meteor comes one at a time, at the same speed, and are of the same size.
- Prompt: How can we improve P00? Brainstorm new features to include in the new prototype.
- Rules:
    - Quantity over quality
    - Defer judgement
    - No buts (just ands)
    - Go wild
    - Get visual
    - Combine ideas
- Set timer for 10 minutes
- After brainstorming exercise, come to a consensus on the coolest feature. (Use your design sense here.)

## Meeting notes

- Amber did really well with the brainstorming exercise
- 1. follow brainstorming instructions; 2 when presenting, group ideas into themes; 3 vote on 1 fav idea from each theme; 4 discuss any disagreements and then pull out the agreed ideas for combining, culling, etc.
