# Project02 Ideation

## Agenda

### Ideation 1

- Share [FigJam file](https://www.figma.com/file/aBs8LAz2j8Jr4bAB3aXHt4/P02_Ideating?node-id=0%3A1)
- Context: P00 lets you move up and down on the screen to avoid incoming meteors. Each meteor comes one at a time, at the same speed, and are of the same size.
- Prompt: How can we improve P00? Brainstorm new features to include in the new prototype.
- Rules:
    - Quantity over quality
    - Defer judgement
    - No buts (just ands)
    - Go wild
    - Get visual
    - Combine ideas
- Set timer for 10 minutes
- After brainstorming exercise, come to a consensus on the coolest feature. (Use your design sense here.)

### Ideation 2

- Share [FigJam file](https://www.figma.com/file/aBs8LAz2j8Jr4bAB3aXHt4/P02_Ideating?node-id=0%3A1)
- Narrow down agreed ideas to 1-2 potential features we can explore.
    - Combine them, cull some we don't like anymore, rewrite some, etc.
- 2-3 more rounds of narrowing ideas until we ge 1-2 potential features

## Meeting notes

### Ideation 1 notes

- Amber did really well with the brainstorming exercise
- 1. follow brainstorming instructions; 2 when presenting, group ideas into themes; 3 vote on 1 fav idea from each theme; 4 discuss any disagreements and then pull out the agreed ideas for combining, culling, etc.

### Ideation 2 notes

- Chosen ideas to implement: 
	- have pewpew sounds for space gun [sound]
	- horizontal movement [coding]
	- drifting [coding]
	- varying speeds of meteors [coding]
	- (Put w/ instructions) There’s a story where you’re escaping from the evil empire that bears no resemblance to an organization in a big-budget sci-fi film series [writing]
- I think I could have given her more autonomy in choosing what ideas to implement
