# Project02 Proposal

v0.1 - Justin Kim - Nov. 08th, 2021

- Initial proposal.

## Title and premise

Countdown (P00 continuation). A short side-scrolling Galaga-variant with retro graphics for a single player where your broken spaceship escapes waves of enemies before it explodes.
 
## Team and organization

Team: 

- Justin (Project manager, Generalist, Designer)
- Amber (Coder)

Justin will journal and record his notes, progress, observations, etc. He will also guide Amber through the game making process.

Amber will focus on learning and practicing the design process while learning to implement games in a fantasy console.

## Preferred tools

Figma:

- Use a shared file for making paper prototypes.
- Upload file to Github under "P02" folder.

Fantasy console: 

- [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Costs $15 and has the best support and community. Lots of resources for learning. Justin already knows PICO-8.
- [Pixel Vision 8](https://pixelvision8.itch.io/pv8). Open-source with more features. Lets you create games in both Lua and C#. More flexible than PICO-8 but loses the benefits of forced constraints. Justin needs to learn this one too.

Final decision: Tell Amber about the differences and ask for her thoughts. Justin already has and prefers PICO-8, but believes it's not fair to ask Amber to spend money.

Github: 

- Host game code and documentation. 
- Use game-studio repo in a folder called "P01".

## Prototype goals

Q: 
- How can we better understand the limitations of P00? 
- It's already a playable prototype. 

A: 

- Explore more ideas for refining the core gameplay experience with paper design prototypes in Figma.
- Refine the playable prototype into a core game prototype in Figma by adding in more mechanics, assets, etc.

## Project timeline and goals

Timeline is subject to change after discussing with Amber her availability. The proposed timeline is 5-6 days. Additional days may be required to learn any new tools.

Meetings are flexible and up for discussion. The proposed cadence is:

- 1 meeting to discuss general logistics,
- 1 meeting for creating the game design document (and any other related materials),
- 1 meeting for brainstorming paper prototypes, and
- 1 meeting for discussing core game prototype.
- 1-2 meetings for implementing the core game prototype (depends on fantasy console chosen).

Milestones:

- Finished paper prototypes (designs).
- Finished core game prototype.

P01 reaches completion when a core game prototype is finalized.
