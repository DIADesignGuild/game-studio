- Proposal for v0.1 of Kishotenketsu Tarot Spread Game

## Title and premise

[Kishotenketsu Tarot Spread Game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bgnpU05j40BGx25Rpb4umxYWp0rPAaY6-49w2q-8cTs/edit?usp=sharing)

A short game for creative writing and Tarot beginners where you learn writing East Asian-style stories and Tarot reading by using [Kishotenketsu](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-structure-of-fun-learning-from-i-super-mario-3d-land-i-s-director#:~:text=First%2C%20you%20have,have%20your%20conclusion.) as both a narrative structure and Tarot card spread. 

## MDA framework
An experience-first framework for ideating and creating a high-level understanding of your game's design.

Can inform parts of your Game Design Document, including but not limited to design values, basic elements, mechanics, etc.

### Aesthetics/Feels
"Aesthetics describes the desirable emotional responses evoked in the player, when she interacts with the game system." - Hunicke, et al.

What does the player experience when playing the game?

### Dynamics/Behavior
"Dynamics describes the run-time behavior of the mechanics acting on player inputs and each others' outputs over time. " - Hunicke, et al.

What are the players doing/encountering to experience something specific?

### Mechanics/Rules
"Mechanics describes the particular components of the game, at the level of data representation and algorithms" - Hunicke, et al.

What constraints do players have to follow and what logic informs said constraints?
 
## Team and organization

Justin is working on this as a personal/passion project for himself. Originally intended for the [Socal Asian Interactive](https://www.facebook.com/groups/socalasianinteractive/) Discord server.

## Preferred tools

- The Rider–Waite–Smith (RWS) Tarot Deck
- [Kishotenketsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu)
- Google Docs
  - Prettier formatting
  - v0.1 is already implemented as a [Google Docs file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bgnpU05j40BGx25Rpb4umxYWp0rPAaY6-49w2q-8cTs/edit?usp=sharing).

## Prototype goals

Questions:
- How can I make a Tarot spread?
- How can I make a Tarot spread more playful?
- How can I make a story using a Tarot spread *and* a narrative structure?
- How can I both interpret Tarot cards to define narrative beats?

The prototype will be a Google Doc with improvements from v0.1 to v0.2. 

## Project timeline and goals

v0.1 - Basic rules, draft concepts, explore problem space
v0.2 - Integrate Tarot reading and narrative writing rules, focus on synergy between Tarot and Kishotenketsu
