-   Pull 2 Meta cards for Character and Starting Situation.   <-- Starting situation is basically the Setup.

-   Players randomly choose which act to write by shuffling the Aces and Royals of the 4 suites (to make shuffling easier) and drawing cards to form the order.  
  -   Ace: Character card.  
  -   Page: Setup card.  
  -   Knight: Development card.  
  -   Queen: Twist card.  
  -   King: Conclusion card.  
  -   Keep drawing cards until you get at least 1 Ace and 1 of each of the Royals. Use the first instance of each card to mark its place in the order.  
    -   Ex: **Ace** **King** **Queen** Queen Ace **Page** King **Knight**  

-   Spread rules  
  -   Horizontal line: Kishotenketsu plot points  
  -   Vertical line:   
    -   Character's state of mind  

-   Synergizing card meanings  
  -   Look at 2 cards and see how they might be connected by asking questions like:  
    -   How are they visually connected?   
      -   Is one card's figure facing the other card? Ex: Is the figure in the VII of Wands glaring at the child in XIX - The Sun?  
      -   Are some items facing towards another card? Ex: Is one of the VII of Wands's wands pointing at the child?  

   1. Separate deck into Major and minor arcanas and shuffle each arcanum pile.

      1. Shuffle arcana piles back together, leaving out Meta cards.


- Added rule for Setting Card (should be drawn before Character Card) and other narrative atomic elements

TODO Digital implementation???

-   TODO Include rules on making each card synergize with the card(s) around it.  
-   TODO Make it obvious that a setup should have a problem, etc. Study Kishotenketsu more closely.  
-   TODO Add explanation on how this helps you learn Kishotenketsu and synergizing card meanings, as well as challenging you to make a story with these constraints.  
-   TODO Add variant rules for multiple Kishotenketsu sub spreads.  
-   TODO Rule(s) where you synergize meanings first OR you synergize as you write the story.  
-   TODO Refine game loop.  

- Time-constraints: Players must finish writing the act's line within the alotted time.
- Decide on a theme or setting beforehand.
- Quick game to make quick 4-line stories.

- Each successive card builds off its preceding card.
  - Ex: The Starting situation card should build off the Character card. The Setup card should build off the Starting situation card. Etc.


- MVP
  - Each card reading's meaning should build off the previous card's meaning. 

Major Arcana: 0-21
Minor Arcana:
- Ace (1), 2-10, Page (11), Knight (12), Queen (13), King (14)
  - 4 groups of 1-14


Tracking how difficult an assignment is/how important a client is?

### Game file itself
- TODO Add self-example made using game
- TODO Add alt. example using existing media like Scott Pilgrim

- TODO Make players write for *exact* word limit?

  - TODO Replace Setting with World?
    - Can the World really be encapsulated in 1 card?
    - Antagonist card?

- TODO How can I tie in Tarot card meanings to my new understanding of KSTK?
  - KSTK cards
    - Setup/Development/Twist/Reconciliation (4 cards)
      - Perspective/Idea/Event cards (2 cards)
        - Setup, Twist (placed vertically higher in spread than other cards)
        - The Character reacts to the World?
        - Whoever acts 2nd reacts to whoever acts 1st?
        - A perspective/idea/event is introduced?
      - Elaboration cards (2 cards)
        - Development, Reconciliation
        - Whoever acts 1st reacts to whoever acts 2nd?
        - A perspective/idea/event is developed?
      - Perspective/Idea/Event/Complication 1 Cards: Setup, Development
      - Perspective/Idea/Event/Complication 2 Cards: Twist, Reconciliation
    - KSTK is essentially how a situation develops. Nothing is "wrong" structurally. A situation is explored.
  - Tree of Life's elements and KSTK
    - Pentacles/Earth >>> Swords/Air >>> Cups/Water >>> Wands/Fire
    - Setup >>> Development >>> Twist >>> Reconciliation
    - **Focus: Rule where you incorporate your answer to a question based on the suite/arcanum into the card line.**
      - This rule most likely will require more time for players to read and understand prompt/question, ruminate, and incorporate into story.
      - If Pentacles/Earth for card then
        - what sensations is your character experiencing?
      - If Swords/Air for card then
        - what are your character's thoughts centered around?
      - If Cups/Water for card then
        - what emotions is your character feeling?
      - If Wands/Fire for card then
        - what are your character's gut feelings?
      - If Major arcana/Path (the journeys inbtwn nodes/sephiroth toward learning lessons) then
        - what moral or fundamental truth does your character learn about?

- TODO What more can I do with card numbers/suites/motifs/etc.?
  - Have repetitive numbers create special effects?
  - multiple cards w/ the same suite stack their effect?
    - The Magician would be a wild card
  - If math, can't be too difficult so the flow isn't interrupted.
  - Poker combinations
    - ~~Royal flush~~ <-- w/ 4-6 cards at a time, not enough
    - Straight (#)
    - ~~Straight flush~~
    - Flush (Suite)
    - 4 of a kind (suite/#)
    - 3 of a kind (suite/#)
    - Pair (suite/#)
    - ~~2 pairs~~ <-- only 10 pairs via #'s, 2 pairs for 2 suites might be too much?>
  - Effects like getting a star in mario kart
  - Combos: For all cards vs just KSTK cards?
    - Just KSTK for now, since they form their own subspread
  - Multiple #'s can indicate certain meanings based on a table?
  - Knowing the sephira, there's 4 worlds based on each element. We know the sephirot are arranged in a sequence where one travels from the 10th sephirot to the 1st of a world before entering the next world.
    - Sequence of sephirot = Most related to a sequence of values like Time.
      - Combo of #'s = time-limit effect
    - World of sephira --> Most related to group of shared attributes like Word-limit.
      - Combo of Suite --> word-limit effect
    - Can increase limits and also decrease them to create variety and up challenge

|Combo|#/Suite|Reversed?|Effect|
|-----|-------|---------|------|
|4 of a kind|#|N|+3 min|
|||Y|-3 min|
||Suite|N|+4 words|
|||Y|-4 words|
|3 of a kind|#|N|+2 min|
|||Y|-2 min|
||Suite|N|+3 words|
|||Y|-3 words|
|Pair|#|N|+1 min|
|||Y|-1 min|
||Suite|N|+2 words|
|||Y|-2 words|

|Straight|#|Time-limit: +4 min|
|Flush|Suite|Word-limit: +5 words|

- TODO Spread arranged in direction of Tree of Life?
  - As it is now, if elements are randomized then the tree hierarchy can't be accurately represented in the spread
  - Unless there's a rule where they re-order cards in spread by element, then number, but that might defeat the purpose of the KSTK spread being made in the first place.


- TODO Add more time for players to explore stories more?
  - Looking at notes for Test 1, 10min felt like enough in hindsight but I remember feeling like I took too long at certain points to write out the story.


It's easier to scan for even numbers of words than odd.
