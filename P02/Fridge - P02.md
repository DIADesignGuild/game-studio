-   Pull 2 Meta cards for Character and Starting Situation.   <-- Starting situation is basically the Setup.

-   Players randomly choose which act to write by shuffling the Aces and Royals of the 4 suites (to make shuffling easier) and drawing cards to form the order.  
  -   Ace: Character card.  
  -   Page: Setup card.  
  -   Knight: Development card.  
  -   Queen: Twist card.  
  -   King: Conclusion card.  
  -   Keep drawing cards until you get at least 1 Ace and 1 of each of the Royals. Use the first instance of each card to mark its place in the order.  
    -   Ex: **Ace** **King** **Queen** Queen Ace **Page** King **Knight**  

-   Spread rules  
  -   Horizontal line: Kishotenketsu plot points  
  -   Vertical line:   
    -   Character's state of mind  

-   Synergizing card meanings  
  -   Look at 2 cards and see how they might be connected by asking questions like:  
    -   How are they visually connected?   
      -   Is one card's figure facing the other card? Ex: Is the figure in the VII of Wands glaring at the child in XIX - The Sun?  
      -   Are some items facing towards another card? Ex: Is one of the VII of Wands's wands pointing at the child?  

   1. Separate deck into Major and minor arcanas and shuffle each arcanum pile.

      1. Shuffle arcana piles back together, leaving out Meta cards.


- Added rule for Setting Card (should be drawn before Character Card) and other narrative atomic elements

TODO Digital implementation???

-   TODO Include rules on making each card synergize with the card(s) around it.  
-   TODO Make it obvious that a setup should have a problem, etc. Study Kishotenketsu more closely.  
-   TODO Add explanation on how this helps you learn Kishotenketsu and synergizing card meanings, as well as challenging you to make a story with these constraints.  
-   TODO Add variant rules for multiple Kishotenketsu sub spreads.  
-   TODO Rule(s) where you synergize meanings first OR you synergize as you write the story.  
-   TODO Refine game loop.  

- Time-constraints: Players must finish writing the act's line within the alotted time.
- Decide on a theme or setting beforehand.
- Quick game to make quick 4-line stories.

- Each successive card builds off its preceding card.
  - Ex: The Starting situation card should build off the Character card. The Setup card should build off the Starting situation card. Etc.


- MVP
  - Each card reading's meaning should build off the previous card's meaning. 

Major Arcana: 0-21
Minor Arcana:
- Ace (1), 2-10, Page (11), Knight (12), Queen (13), King (14)
  - 4 groups of 1-14
