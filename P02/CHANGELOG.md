# Changelog

## v0.2 (Dec. 19th - Dec. XXth, 2021)
- Made P02 Proposal.
- Made P02 GDD.
- Added game as P02 in DIA Game Studio.
- Note: The design started to come together when I came up with some of these ideas and kept thinking of how they impact the game.

### Basic elements
- Removed Starting situation card (it's basically the Setup card)
- Added in v0.1 rules into P02 GDD
- Added rule for Setting Card (should be drawn before Character Card).
- Added rule where added values of all cards lets you pick out a theme from a pre-made table
- Added rule to make X amount of KSTK stories in Y amt of time
- Added rule for failing forward where if players cant finish x stories in y time, let them start over but keep their old stories/scores for the new round
- Added rule where if players fail to complete x stories in y time for round z, they have to use a smaller word limit for the next round. 
- Added rule where finishing a level could result in a promotion to a job title.
- Updated list of Objects, Actions, Goals, etc.
- Added Scoring section to Rules.

### Design values
- Added context to GDD about how P02 is a creative exercise game; main mechanics include constraints like time [EXPERIENCE]
- DONE 12/31/21 Defined what kind of stories P02 aims to produce [EXPERIENCE]
- DONE 12/__/21, 12/31/21 Changed meta theme: Game about writing a series, like a tv series or a book series, or a comic book series [Point of view]
- DONE 12/31/21 Elaborated how kishotenketsu doesn't need driving conflict to guide the story; it can take time to explore instead [CONTEXT]
- DONE 01/01/22 Discuss how line-word and time limits along with rules for failure create a meta where building up an extensive vocabulary for writing with brevity is the best strategy (AFAIK). [Skill, strategy, chance, and uncertainty]
- DONE 01/01/22 Discussed how challenge in game arises from constraints. [CHALLENGE]
- TODO Add NPC's based on Major arcana to game's meta narrative [Point of view]

### Game flow
- DONE 01/02/22 Fix gameflow to reflect the flow in the rules.

### Level design
- DONE 01/03/2022 Added levels where you make diff media
  - Ex: Lvl 1 = Write a novel plot, Lvl 2 = Write 3 stories that make up a movie trilogy.
  - Each lvl has a diff amount for the word and time limits.
- DONE 01/03/2022 Added word-limit for each story/act line.
- Made theme table for Level 0.
- Made formula for referring to theme table.
- DONE 01/03/2022 Add eligibility for promotion to next job title in certain levels (tie milestones to certain levels).
- DONE 01/03/2022 Add rule to level 0 where players can choose a number from 1 to 5 for the arcanas and then a number from 0 to 21 or 1 to 14 depending on the arcana. This way they can play without buying actual cards.
- DONE 01/03/2022 Added benefits for promotions.
