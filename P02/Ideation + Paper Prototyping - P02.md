# Project02 Ideation + Paper Prototyping 

## Agenda

### Ideation

- Share [FigJam file](https://www.figma.com/file/aBs8LAz2j8Jr4bAB3aXHt4/P02_Ideating?node-id=0%3A1)
- Context: P00 lets you move up and down on the screen to avoid incoming meteors. Each meteor comes one at a time, at the same speed, and are of the same size.
- Prompt: How can we improve P00? Brainstorm new features to include in the new prototype.
- After brainstorming exercise, come to a consensus on the coolest feature. (Use your design sense here.)

### Paper Prototyping

- Share [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/9j88mdJp1r8c7J9ATIw31B/P02_Paper-Prototyping?node-id=0%3A1)
- Create in-depth schematics for the feature. 
- Ex: Include details like basic algorithm/user flow, dimensions (px), storyboards, edge cases, etc.

### Homework

#### Amber

- Begin recreating P00 in PV8

#### Justin
