# Project02 Paper Prototyping 

## Agenda

### Paper Prototyping

- Share [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/9j88mdJp1r8c7J9ATIw31B/P02_Paper-Prototyping?node-id=0%3A1)
- Create in-depth schematics for the feature. 
- Ex: Include details like basic algorithm/user flow, dimensions (px), storyboards, edge cases, etc.

### Homework

#### Amber

- Begin recreating P00 in PV8
- Refer to [p00.p8](https://github.com/DIADesignGuild/game-studio/blob/main/P00/p00.p8 "p00.p8")

#### Justin

- Update P02 Game Design Document
- Also recreate P00 in PV8 (note conversion from PICO-8 Lua to regular Lua)

## Meeting notes

- Slow, normal, and fast meteors with speeds based on the ship's base speed
- Ship drifting: when the player lets go of the move button the ship deaccelerates for x sec.
	- During drifting, if the player has let go of the move button but the ship touches the meteor while drifting, the ship is destroyed.
- If the ship is accelerating in one direction and the player suddenly moves in a different direction, then the ship will deaccelerate. 
- Find out way to make paper prototyping more fun in Figma
- Amber seemed to be more engaged when I asked her to consider what needs to be asked about each idea
